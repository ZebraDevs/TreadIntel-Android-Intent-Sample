Respective API reference documents can be fount at https://techdocs.zebra.com/

### Prerequisits
This application necessitates the attachment of the Zebra Tread Intel Snap-On to the mobile computer. Additionally, the mobile computer must have the Zebra Tread Intel Android Framework installed.

### API summery:
INITIATE: Initiate Tread Reader framework session.
GET_PARAMS: Get the Tread Reader parameter values.
SET_PARAMS: Set the Tread Reader parameter values.
START: Start measurement and send data back to the application via pending intent.
VERSION: Get the Tread Reader framework version data.
CURRENT_STATE: Query the Tread Reader framework, connection state and framework state
ON_STATE_CHANGE: Register to receive notifications when the framework connection state or framework state changes.
RELEASE: Release the Tread Reader framework session.

The Tread Intel and its framework are designed for the Zebraâ€™s TC7x and TC5x series devices. These terminals provide the necessary hardware and software capabilities to support the advanced functionalities of the Tread Intel.

### Important Points
|-Suported minimum SDK version: 30
|-Make sure that the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is enabled to allow full access to external storage.
|-Add queries tag
    For support devices which use Android 13 and above  add the <queries> tag in the AndroidManifest.xml of the application to define package name for Tread Intel. This required to allow the Tread Intel API to communicate with the application.
 
    <queries>    
        <package android:name="com.zebra.intentapis" />
    </queries>
